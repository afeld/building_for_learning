# Course Proposal

## Course description

The web has already revolutionized the way that people consume information, but only recently has it been taken seriously as an avenue for teaching. MOOCs, online tutorials, and interactive applications all offer different means of learning, from the highly structured to the exploratory. They raise new questions around evaluation and assessment, while providing new avenues for collaboration and opportunities for students outside of traditional learning environments.

In this class, we will examine various educational platforms and tools, and get the opportunity to speak with their creators. What can we offer to teachers to make their lives easier? What features increase and sustain student engagement? The course will be largely project-based, where students will learn frontend web development skills to build new web-based learning experiences and tools.

## What will the students do?

The goal is to get students to think through various trade-offs inherent to both online learning platforms and in-person classes and textbooks, as well as their relation to one another. They will think through all elements of designing a learning platform: pedagogical approaches, participation, and feedback mechanisms.

I want to experiment with not only developing these applications within a team, but also getting feedback from “3rd-party stakeholders” – that is, other students from other teams. The teaching of the class itself will be largely collaborative, with students sharing skills gained, coding frameworks discovered, or information learned in pursuit of the projects as a Show & Tell.

## How will the course be structured?

Every week, we will cover a technical topic related to frontend web development. Students will then complete one- or two-week assignments building small educational tools, in order to practice those skills.

I’m debating between one large group development project, or two smaller ones. In the former scenario, they could design and build something relatively substantial. In the latter, I might split it by having one project focused on content, with the other focused on interactivity. In either case, the projects can be started relatively early in the term, encouraging “failing fast” and iteration throughout the course as more information is gained.

I love the brown bag lunch idea from [Hacking Higher Ed](http://itp.nyu.edu/~dbo3/hack-ed/), and would like to steal the idea for talks by/with professionals in the online education space. The in-class time would be split in thirds, with one part devoted to me introducing a technical or education-related topic, another part discussion with a guest, and the third as time for students to present in their Show & Tell / Skill Shares.

## Who will teach it?
