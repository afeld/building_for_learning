# Assignment Workflow

1. Fork the repository for the assignment, which should appear at `github.com/YOU/REPOSITORY`.
1. Click the "Clone in Desktop" button on the right sidebar.
1. Open the `index.html` file in a browser and open the Developer Tools.
1. Modify the files, and add any files/libraries/assets you need.
1. Make small commits as you go.
1. Refresh the `index.html` page to see the results, and repeat.
1. Explain your project in the README:
    * How it evolved (with photos is a plus)
    * Links/images/[video](http://stackoverflow.com/a/14945782/358804) of any inspiration or resources that were helpful
    * Feel free to put the above information in a blog post, and simply link from the README instead.
1. Make sure all of your changes are committed.
1. "Sync" your commits from the GitHub app.
1. [Create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request) on the original repository.
1. You can continue to push fixes and improvements while the pull request is Open – just add a comment in the pull request to let me know it's been updated.

## Live Preview

Your solution will be live at `http://USERNAME.github.io/REPOSITORY`. Note that after your initial push/sync, it may take up to ten minutes for the site to appear.

## Automatic Style Checking

When the pull request is created, you should see a message saying that "the Travis CI build is in progress" – this means that your solution is being automatically checked for syntax errors. If this "build" ends up failing (which will show a red "X"), click through the "details" link and scroll to the bottom to see what the errors were. This automated feedback will help you write better code. If it's green, you're good to go.

## Discussion

I will leave feedback in the pull request, so please respond with your thoughts and questions! You are welcome to open the pull request as a work-in-progress if you are stuck and want to ask a question – just mention `@afeld` to make sure I get the notification.
